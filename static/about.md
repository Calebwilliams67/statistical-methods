Hi, I'm Caleb Williams and I am from Jonesboro, Arkansas. I am 18 years old and I'm currently attending my first year at the University of Arkansas. I am a Data Science major with the hope of one day having a masters in Business analytics. My favorite hobbies include golfing, hunting, and spending time with my fraternity.
